Since I was kid I liked computers. Growing up, I spent many hours of my free time on the internet. So, I started experimenting with learning the basics of HTML and CSS. Therefore, I created this project to improve my knowledge of coding. It helped me better understand how Github, HTML, CSS and Javascript work.
